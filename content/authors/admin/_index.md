I'm a PhD Candidate in the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara (USA) and the Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig (Germany). After spending three years (fall 2016 - summer 2019) at UCSB, I'm now based at the MPI in Leipzig working on my dissertation on Mixtecan language history. 

Here's a brief overview of the things I'm working on or have worked on in the past:

* phylogenetics and computational methods for exploring language history
* community-based language documentation (Mixtec, Otomanguean)
* statistical methods for assessing theoretical claims (morphological autonomy and wordhood)
* diachronic typology (voice and person marking, interrogatives as relativization markers)

I'm originally from Bern (Switzerland). I did my BA and MA in General Linguistics and Comparative Indo-European Linguistics at the University of Zürich, Switzerland. I had such a great time there that I stayed for another year working as a research assistant before starting my PhD at UCSB in 2016.
